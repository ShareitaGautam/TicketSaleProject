# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

# Ticket Sale Project

## Project Overview

The Ticket Sale DApp leverages blockchain technology to streamline and secure the process of buying, reselling, and swapping event tickets. Built with Solidity and Hardhat, this decentralized application ensures transparency, security, and efficiency in ticket transactions.

## Key Features

1. Secure Ticket Purchase
   - Users can securely purchase tickets for events, with all transactions recorded on the Ethereum blockchain.

2. Ticket Resale Marketplace
   - Enables users to resell their purchased tickets, creating a flexible and fair secondary market.

3. Effortless Ticket Swapping
   - Facilitates easy swapping of tickets between users, providing flexibility in ticket management.

4. Comprehensive Event Management
   - Equips event organizers with tools to manage events, set ticket pricing, and monitor sales performance.

5. Blockchain-Powered Transparency
   - Ensures secure and transparent transactions, minimizing fraud and enhancing user trust.
